# NN test for the three-class problem

## Files

- testNN_ColorDB3D.m: Main file with the NN implementation. You should probably start with this file
- activationFunction.m: implementation of the different activation functions
- forwardPropagationv2.m: implementation of the forward propagation function. This function calculates the net for the hidden and output layers
- backwardPropagationv2.m: implementation of the backward propagation to update the weights of the hidden and output layers
- colorDB3D.mat: Database for training the NN
